This is the code for looping the music:

while (true) {
		new AudioPlayer("sounds/game.wav").start();
		try {
			Thread.currentThread().sleep(76000);
		}
		catch (Exception e) {}
	     }

It needs to be put at the end of a method i think. Amir will be working on it
as well, but maybe you can try to solve it too.
